   - Enter your credentials:
     - **JUDGMENT_API_KEY**: Your API key from [JudgmentLabs Dashboard](https://app.judgmentlabs.ai/)
     - **JUDGMENT_ORG_ID**: Your organization ID from the dashboard

4. **Enable and Test**:
   - Toggle the extension to **"Enabled"**
   - Restart Claude Desktop
   - Test by asking: *"Create a new project called 'test-project'"*

### Method 2: Build Your Own DXT Package (Advanced Users) ‚öôÔ∏è

For developers who want to build the DXT package from source:

#### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Node.js and npm

#### Build Steps
```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
